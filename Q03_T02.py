'''
Python Data Types and type() Function
Objective:
The aim of this assignment is to practice identifying and using Python's basic data types, as well as the type() function for checking a variable's data type.

Task 1: Code Correction
Given below are some variable assignments. Your task is to identify the data type of each variable and then use the type() function to print it out:

variable_a = "Hello, World!"
variable_b = 23
variable_c = 3.14
variable_d = True
'''

variable_a = "Hello, World!" # This will be a string.
print(variable_a, type(variable_a))

variable_b = 23 # This should be an integer.
print(variable_b, type(variable_b))

variable_c = 3.14 # This one will come back a float.
print(variable_c, type(variable_c))

variable_d = True #This one is a boolean.
print(variable_d, type(variable_d))
