3. Python Naming Convention Practice
Objective:
The aim of this assignment is to understand and apply Python's naming conventions, particularly for variables and constants.

Task 1: Code Correction
You have been given a piece of code with several variable and constant names that don't follow the Python naming convention. Your task is to correct them:

Pi_value = 3.14
userAge = 25
user_location = "New York"
MAXLIMIT = 1000
'''

pi_value = 3.14
user_age = 25
user_location = "New York" # I think this one is already right. I had nothing to change that I could see.
MAX_LIMIT = 1000 # This one is I just added a _ for a constant name.
