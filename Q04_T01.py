4. Python Dynamic Typing Practice
Objective:
The aim of this assignment is to get hands-on with Python's dynamic typing feature, which allows variables to change their data type during runtime.

Task 1: Code Correction
Below is a piece of code where a variable's data type changes. Your task is to print the type of the variable after each assignment to see the dynamic nature in action:

dynamic_variable = "This is a string"
# (Your code to print the type of dynamic_variable here)

dynamic_variable = 100
# (Your code to print the type of dynamic_variable here)

dynamic_variable = 25.5
# (Your code to print the type of dynamic_variable here)
Remember, in Python, it's not about the variable itself, but the value it holds that determines its type!
'''

dynamic_variable = "This is a string"
print(dynamic_variable, type(dynamic_variable))

dynamic_variable = 100
print(dynamic_variable, type(dynamic_variable))

dynamic_variable = 25.5
print(dynamic_variable, type(dynamic_variable))
