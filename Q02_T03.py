Task 3: Combining Single and Multi-line Comments
Choose one line from your single-line comment poem and another line from your multi-line comment poem. Put these lines into a new Python script and separate them with a descriptive single-line comment about each.

For instance:

# This line is from my first poem
# With every new challenge, you're hard to beat.

# This line is from my multi-line poem

With simplicity and grace, you're truly divine.

'''

# It may seem hard

# Something about both poems I wrote. Nothing that is worth while in life comes easy. We are going to face challenges at each step, it's how we adapt to those challenges that make it great. 
 
''' I say it's all of them, thats life! '''
